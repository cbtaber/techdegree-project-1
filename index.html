        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am currently in a state of career transition.  Having worked primarily  in expendable mid-level financial administration roles for most of my professional career, I decided to explore my options that aligned with my interests and develop skills that could future-proof my career.</p> 
        <p>I have been studying web development and design on and off for the past three years, I am now working on a professional project portfolio to show to potential employers.  The journey so far has been exciting and challenging.  </p>
        <p>I am a film lover of every genre with a collection of over 5000 movies from all over the world. When not watching movies, I also enjoy spending time with family, discovering new restaurants and watching coding tutorials on YouTube. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am looking to become an expert in as many languages and frameworks as time will allow so that I can create and manage engaging and robust web experiences.  I am currently concentrating on the following programming skills:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          
          
        </ul>
        <p>I am eager to join a creative development agency and put to use the creativity and problem solving skills that I have honed through my previous roles and current educational endeavors.</p> 
        <p>The ultimate goal would be to find a role that allows me to work remotely in order to spend more time with family and less time in a car.</p>
